# vRP Business

## Description
  With this script you can set up businesses which will be owned by players. You can buy a company, hire people, fire them and even sell the company. Since this script has [vRP_companyaccs]() as a dependency, each business will also have a bank account to store their money in, and it'll also grow over time thanks to interest rates (which can be set upon your liking!).\
  Each company has their indipendent permission, so you can create missions or menus to do stuff for them. For example a dealership where only employees can buy cars, a gun store or a bank.

        _config = { gtype = "business", figlio = "Bank Employee", name = "bank",
            onspawn = function(player) vRPclient.notify(player,{"You are the bank director."}) end
        },
        "propr.aut",
        "propr.banca_tax",
        "banca.vehicle",
        "propr.banca_money",
        "banca.mission",
        "banca.menu",
        "banca.cassa",
        "conto.v2",
        "conto.v1",
        "banca.pos"
    },

    ["Bank Employee"] = {
            _config = { gtype = "business",
            onspawn = function(player) vRPclient.notify(player,{"You are a bank employee."}) end
        },
        "dip.aut",
        "banca.vehicle",
        "banca.menu",
        "banca.cassa",
        "banca.mission",
        "conto.v1",
        "banca.pos"
    },
    ```
    </details>

## Instructions
  * To add a new company you must add it to the ```cfg.blips``` table, situated in the ```vrp_business\cfg\config.lua``` file, and also to the ```blips``` table in ```vrp_business\client.lua```:
    <details><summary>SHOW</summary>
    
    ```lua
    ["bank"] = {title="Pacific Standard", prezzo= 2000000, gruppo="Bank Director", x=263.72836303711,y=223.23931884766,z=101.68327331543},
    ```
    "bank" -> This is the internal name of the business, it won't be shown in game.\
    title -> This is the real name of the business.\
    prezzo -> The price a player pays to buy the company.\
    gruppo -> The group that's the owner of the company, only one player should have it. You must add it to the ```vrp\cfg\groups.lua``` file as written [above](#changes-to-vrp-mandatory).\
    x,y,z -> The coordinates where players will be able to buy the business.
    </details>

    Add the owner and employee groups to the ```vrp\cfg\groups.lua``` file, being careful to change the permissions (except for conto.v1, conto.v2, propr.aut and dip.aut, those should always stay the same!).
